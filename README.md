By offering creative and easy-to-follow recipes, the project aims to empower homemakers to transform surplus food into delicious and nutritious meals, reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption habits.

The project's core objective is to bridge the gap between reducing food wastage and enhancing culinary creativity. By leveraging technology to suggest inventive ways to repurpose leftovers, the "Leftover Food Recommendation" project envisions a positive impact on household food management, financial savings, and ecological sustainability. Ultimately, this initiative strives to empower homemakers to play a pivotal role in minimizing food wastage while embracing culinary exploration.
